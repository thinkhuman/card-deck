# REQUIREMENTS

# Using Python, please write a set of classes that represent a deck of cards. 
# Classes like "card" and "deck" might be appropriate- but it's entirely up to you. 
# You should be able to "shuffle" the deck. 
# You should also be able to draw cards from the deck one at a time until the deck is empty. 
# Unit tests are required, and the code should be usable from other code. 
# If you want to include a user interface, that's fine, but it's not required.
